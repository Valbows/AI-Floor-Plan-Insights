# 30-Second Pitch Script

## THE PROBLEM (30 seconds)

*[Confident, conversational tone]*

"When you're designing a new development, you need to know:

**What unit layouts will maximize price per square foot?**

Right now, that means:
- **Manually reading** every floor plan in your comp set - living room width, bedroom length, kitchen dimensions
- **One at a time** - pulling floor plans from StreetEasy, Zillow, typing dimensions into Excel
- **Running regression analysis** - correlating every dimension to PPSF to find what actually drives value

**This takes 2-3 MONTHS per market analysis.**

*[Pause]*

And when your intern leaves? You lose all that institutional knowledge.

*[Pause - let it sink in]*

What if you could analyze alot of comparable properties in **under 2 hours**?"

## THE SOLUTION (30 seconds)

*[Energetic, excited tone]*

"That's exactly what we built.

** upload floor plans** - of wherever you're building.

Our AI extracts all dimensions, pulls sale prices, calculates PPSF, and runs correlation analysis automatically.
and speed up the process from 
**2-3 months to 2 hours.**
Let us show you..."
" is going to walk you through a live example. Watch how fast this is."

## ALTERNATIVE VERSIONS

### Version B - More Data-Focused

**PROBLEM (30 seconds):**

"Real estate development is data-driven. But getting the data is still manual.

You need to know: What unit layouts maximize PPSF? What dimensions actually drive value?

To answer that, you're pulling 100+ floor plans from StreetEasy. An intern measures every room by hand - living room width, living room length, bedroom dimensions, kitchen size. Types it all into Excel.

**2-3 months later** - you finally have enough data to run regression analysis.

The result? You discover 17' x 21' living rooms correlate to 12% higher PPSF. Second bedrooms? Size doesn't matter.

But when the intern leaves, the analysis stops. The institutional knowledge is lost.

This is your competitive advantage - but it doesn't scale."

**SOLUTION (30 seconds):**

"We automated the entire process with AI.

**Computer vision** extracts precise dimensions from any floor plan - even hand-drawn sketches or photos. Living room width, bedroom length, every measurement.

**Bulk analysis** - upload 100 floor plans, get dimensions for all of them in minutes.

**Automated correlation** - we pull sale prices, calculate PPSF, show you which dimensions matter most.

**Export to CSV** - all the data you need for your own regression analysis.

It's like having an intern who never sleeps and can analyze 100 properties in an hour.

Let me show you..."

### Version C - For Andrew Specifically (Gowanus Project)

**PROBLEM (30 seconds):**

"Andrew, you told us your biggest pain point:

When you were designing units for your Gowanus project, you needed to know which layouts would maximize PPSF.

So you had an intern manually measure every condo floor plan in Brooklyn. 
- Living room width
- Living room length  
- Bedroom dimensions
- Kitchen size

**2-3 months. 2,320 properties.**

You discovered 17' x 21' living rooms had the highest correlation to PPSF. Second bedrooms? Size didn't matter much.

That data gave you a **massive competitive advantage** when pitching investors.

But when the intern left, the analysis stopped. And you can't do this for every market you build in."

**SOLUTION (30 seconds):**

"We automated that entire process for you.

Upload all the floor plans for a neighborhood - Gowanus, Williamsburg, wherever you're building.

Our AI:
- **Extracts every dimension** - living room width, bedroom length, all of it
- **Pulls sale prices** from StreetEasy, Zillow, calculates PPSF
- **Runs correlation analysis** - shows you which dimensions drive value
- **Exports to CSV** - so you can run your own regression in Excel

From **2-3 months to 2 hours**.

And you can do this for every new market instantly.

Here's the Gowanus analysis..."

## DEMO CHECKLIST FOR TEAMMATE

*This is what your teammate should demo for Andrew:*

### 1. BULK UPLOAD (20 seconds)
- Show the upload interface
- Say: "I'm going to upload floor plans from Gowanus properties"
- Upload 3-5 floor plans (or show bulk upload capability)
- Say: "In production, you'd upload 100+ at once"

### 2. DIMENSION EXTRACTION (45 seconds)
- Show a sample property with floor plan
- Point out the detailed measurements:
  - ✅ "AI extracted: Living room 17' x 21'"
  - ✅ "Bedroom 1: 12' x 14', Bedroom 2: 10' x 12'"
  - ✅ "Kitchen: 8' x 10'"
  - ✅ "Total square footage: 1,200 sq ft"

- Say: "It pulled recent sales from StreetEasy"
- Show PPSF calculations:
  - "This unit: $1,450/sqft"
  - "Comps average: $1,380/sqft"
  - "4% premium"

### 4. CORRELATION ANALYSIS (45 seconds)
- **THIS IS THE KEY PART FOR ANDREW**
- Show dimension-to-PPSF correlation
- Say: "Here's what dimensions correlate to higher PPSF:"
  - "Living rooms 17-21' wide: $1,500/sqft average"
  - "Living rooms 13-16' wide: $1,350/sqft average"
  - "Second bedroom size: Minimal impact on pricing"
- Say: "This is the same insight you found manually - but automated"

### 5. EXPORT DATA (20 seconds)
- Click "Export to CSV"
- Say: "All dimensions and pricing data in Excel format"
- Show what the CSV looks like:
  - Address, Living Room Width, Living Room Length, BR1 Width, BR1 Length, Sale Price, PPSF
- Say: "You can run your own regression analysis in Excel just like before"

### 6. CLOSER (15 seconds)
- Say: "From 2-3 months of manual work to **2 hours**"
- "And you can do this for every market you build in"
- "Gowanus, Williamsburg, wherever - instant comp set analysis"

**TOTAL DEMO TIME: ~3 minutes**

## SPEAKING TIPS

### For YOU (Problem + Solution):

**DO:**
- ✅ Speak clearly and confidently
- ✅ Use hand gestures for emphasis on numbers
- ✅ Make eye contact (or look at camera)
- ✅ Pause after "What if..." questions
- ✅ Smile when saying "Let me show you..."

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Rush through it - let the problem land
- ❌ Use jargon ("AI/ML" is fine, but not "neural networks" or "OCR")
- ❌ Apologize or say "um" - practice until smooth
- ❌ Read from script - memorize and deliver naturally

### For TEAMMATE (Demo):

**DO:**
- ✅ Move mouse slowly and deliberately
- ✅ Narrate what you're doing

## ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS (Have Quick Answers Ready)

**Q: "Can you pull floor plans automatically from StreetEasy/Zillow instead of manual upload?"**
A: "Yes! That's on our roadmap. We can integrate with REMNY (New York MLS) or scrape from StreetEasy, Zillow, Redfin. The AI works on any floor plan image - website screenshot, PDF, photo - doesn't matter."

**Q: "What if the dimensions aren't labeled on the floor plan?"**
A: "Great question. If dimensions are clearly labeled, we extract them with high confidence. If not labeled, the AI estimates based on scale and typical room proportions. We flag which measurements are exact vs estimated. Either way, you get usable data."

**Q: "Can I see living room dimensions specifically broken down?"**
A: "Absolutely. We extract: Living room width, living room length, Bedroom 1 width/length, Bedroom 2 width/length, kitchen dimensions - basically every measurement your intern was typing into Excel. All exportable to CSV."

**Q: "How do you calculate correlation to PPSF?"**
A: "We pull actual sale prices from recent comps, calculate PPSF for each unit, then correlate that to each dimension. So you can see: 17' x 21' living rooms = $1,500/sqft avg, vs 13' x 16' = $1,350/sqft. You can also export all the raw data to run your own regression analysis in Excel."

**Q: "Can I analyze 100+ properties at once?"**
A: "Yes. Bulk upload is built-in. Upload all the floor plans for a neighborhood, AI processes them in parallel. For 100 properties, you're looking at maybe 1-2 hours total processing time."

**Q: "What about unit mix optimization - can you recommend what to build?"**
A: "Phase 1 gives you the data to make that decision - dimensions correlated to PPSF. Phase 2 (roadmap) would be predictive: 'Design a unit, we'll predict the PPSF.' Right now, you get the data, you make the call."

**Q: "Can this work for other markets outside Brooklyn?"**
A: "Yes - any market where floor plans are available. The AI doesn't care about location - it reads floor plans. The PPSF correlation is market-specific, so you'd analyze Gowanus separately from Williamsburg, but same process."

**Q: "What's the pricing?"**
A: "[Have your pricing model ready - per property analysis, monthly subscription for unlimited, enterprise custom, etc.]"

## BACKUP SLIDES (If Demo Fails)

Have these screenshots ready to show:

1. **Floor Plan Upload Interface**
2. **AI Analysis Results** (show extracted data)
3. **Comparable Properties Chart**
4. **Investment Score Breakdown**
5. **Shareable Report View**

*If tech fails, say:* "Let me show you some screenshots while we troubleshoot..." - never panic!

---

## CLOSING LINE (After Demo)

*[Your teammate finishes demo and hands back to you]*

"So - **from 2-3 months of manual analysis to under 2 hours**.

No more intern measuring floor plans with a ruler.
No more typing dimensions into Excel one by one.
No more losing institutional knowledge when people leave.

**You can now do comp set analysis for every market you build in.**

And when you're pitching investors, you can say: *'We know exactly what the market wants because we analyzed 500+ comparable units in 2 hours.'*

**That's your competitive advantage - automated.**
